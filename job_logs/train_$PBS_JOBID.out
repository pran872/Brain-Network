/rds/general/user/psp20/home/Brain-Network/source/flex.py:91: TracerWarning: Converting a tensor to a Python boolean might cause the trace to be incorrect. We can't record the data flow of Python values, so this value will be treated as a constant in the future. This means that the trace might not generalize to other inputs!
  assert tensor_1.shape == tensor_2.shape, "tensor_1 and tensor_2 must have the same shape"
